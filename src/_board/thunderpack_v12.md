A kick-ass microcontroller board with everything you need in a compact package that fits in your pocket. Integrated battery, power management system, Arm microcontroller, USB bootloader, 4 high-power PWM outputs, and 12 GPIOs.

Why? After years of wiring together portable LED controllers that all consisted of a lithum batter, charge controller, power switch, and an arduino nano (or similar), I wanted something better. I always found those versions to be janky and fragile -- not to mention concerned that damaging the pouch cell battery might make it explode! This board has everything I need with room to expand.

Features
 * Ultra-low-power 32-bit microcontroller (STM32L072xx)
* Integrated high-capacity 18650 lithium battery
* 4 high-current PWM outputs (2.3A per channel!) with an LED on each for debugging.
* 12 GPIOs, USART, I2C, SPI, USB
* 6k EEPROM
* USB bootloader
* Tactile on/off switch
* Tactile user button with built-in debounce circuit
* Breadboard friendly
* Durable AF! (Put a tube of heat shrink around it for a super easy case, if you'd like.)
