Snekboard is designed to hook up to Lego Power Functions motors and
switches, allowing you to build robots out of Lego and control them
with CircuitPython or the simpler
[snek programming language](https://keithp.com/snek).

Snekboard is 48mm Ã— 48mm, which is the same size as 6 x 6 Lego studs
allowing you to build a box out of Lego to hold it attached to your
Lego design. It uses a single cell lithium polymer battery that fits
under the board and charges over USB while snekboard is being
programmed from the host.
