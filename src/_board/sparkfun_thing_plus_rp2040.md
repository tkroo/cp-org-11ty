The SparkFun Thing Plus - RP2040 is a low-cost, high performance board with flexible digital interfaces featuring the Raspberry Pi Foundation's RP2040 microcontroller. Besides the Thing Plus or *Feather* footprint (with 18 GPIO pins), the board also includes an SD card slot, 16MB (128Mbit) flash memory, a JST single cell battery connector (with a charging circuit and fuel gauge sensor), an addressable WS2812 RGB LED, JTAG PTH pins, four (4-40 screw) mounting holes, and our signature Qwiic connector.

The RP2040 contains two ARM Cortex-M0+ processors (up to 133MHz) and features:

- 264kB of embedded SRAM in six banks
- 6 dedicated IO for SPI Flash (supporting XIP)
- 30 multifunction GPIO:
  - Dedicated hardware for commonly used peripherals
  - Programmable IO for extended peripheral support
  - Four 12-bit ADC channels with internal temperature sensor (up to 0.5 MSa/s)
- USB 1.1 Host/Device functionality

The RP2040 is supported with both C/C++ and MicroPython cross-platform development environments, including easy access to runtime debugging. It has UF2 boot and floating-point routines baked into the chip. While the chip has a large amount of internal RAM, the board includes an additional 16MB of external QSPI flash memory to store program code.
