The datum-IMU sensor combines the same SAMD21G18 microcontroller used on the Arduino Zero with the LSM9DS1 IMU sensor from ST Microelectronics to create the simplest, easiest to use IMU sensor for your application.

The datum-IMU sensor emulates a serial port over a USB connection, presents the information and data stored on it in a JSON formatted packet, and processes URI style commands to change and retrieve its settings. The datum-IMU sensor fills the gap between a LEGO® Mindstorms® sensor and a breakout board.

The datum-IMU sensor can do much more than just collect the data. The measurement units can be customized to suit your application. IMU data can be returned in mm, cm, inches, or feet. The datum-IMU sensor does all the calculations for you.

It can also apply filters such as min, mix, mean, and RMS to the data stream. This truly makes the datum-IMU sensor a smart sensor that goes far beyond what a breakout board can do.
