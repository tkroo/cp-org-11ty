In addition to being a 4-port USB 2 High-Speed hub, this Programmable USB hub is also:

*   A CircuitPython based development board.
*   A bridge between your computer and I2C (via Sparkfun Qwiic connectors), GPIO, and SPI (via its mikroBUS header).
*   A power supply, providing 6 A of 5 V power to downstream devices and 13 mA resolution monitoring (per-port).
*   A USB to TTL Serial adapter.
*   A flexible embedded electronics test and development tool.
*   Mountable.
*   Functionally flexible. Open source python drivers on the upstream host and Python firmware on the internal MCU allow the behavior of this USB hub to be easily changed to suit your application and environment.
