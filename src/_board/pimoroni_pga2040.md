A minimal RP2040 breakout board wrangled into a Pin Grid Array, with a maximal dash of retraux style. PGA2040 has no USB port, LED or buttons but it does have an embed-friendly 21mm square footprint, 8MB of flash and lots of exposed RP2040 pins to play with.

## Features
* Powered by RP2040
* Dual ARM Cortex M0+ running at up to 133Mhz
* 264kB of SRAM
* 8MB of QSPI flash supporting XiP
* Crystal oscillator
* On-board 3V3 regulator (max regulator current output 300mA)
* 48 pins, arranged with 2.54mm (0.1") spacing in a Pin Grid Array
* 30 multi-function General Purpose IO (4 can be used for ADC)
* 8 GND pins
* Input voltage range 3V - 5.5V (on VB pin)

## About the RP2040
The RP2040 microcontroller is a dual core ARM Cortex M0+ running at up to 133Mhz. It bundles in 264kB of SRAM, 30 multifunction GPIO pins (including a four channel 12-bit ADC), a heap of standard peripherals (I2C, SPI, UART, PWM, clocks, etc), and USB support.

One very exciting feature of the RP2040 microcontroller are the programmable IOs which allow you to execute custom programs that can manipulate GPIO pins and transfer data between peripherals - they can offload tasks that require high data transfer rates or precise timing that traditionally would have required a lot of heavy lifting from the CPU.
