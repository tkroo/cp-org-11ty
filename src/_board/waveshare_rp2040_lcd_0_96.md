RP2040-LCD-0.96 is a low-cost, high-performance Pico-like MCU board with flexible digital interfaces. It incorporates Raspberry Pi's RP2040 microcontroller chip, as same as the one on Raspberry Pi Pico. For software development, either Raspberry Pi's C/C++ SDK, or the MicroPython is available, which makes it easy for you to get started, and integrate it into end products quickly.

In additional, there're also onboard 0.96inch IPS display, Lithium battery recharge/discharge header, and high efficiency DC-DC buck-boost chip.
