Squeeeeze down your next ESP32 project to its bare-bones essential with the **Adafruit HUZZAH32 Breakout**. This breakout is basically the 'big sister' of our HUZZAH 8266, but instead of an ESP8266 it has the '32! We've pared down our popular [Feather ESP32](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405), removing the battery charger and USB-serial converter. You just get a regulator, some protection diodes, two buttons and an LED. For some projects, where price and size are at a premium, you can program this board over the 'FTDI cable' breakout when needed, and leave it alone otherwise.

Note that this board *doesn't* come with a USB to serial converter chip and auto-reset circuit. Instead, you will need to plug in a [CP2104 Friend](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3309) or [FTDI cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/70). Then, before uploading code, put it into bootloader mode by holding down the GPIO #0 button and clicking Reset button, then releasing the #0 button.

That module in the middle of the breakout contains a dual-core ESP32 chip, 4 MB of SPI Flash, tuned antenna, and all the passives you need to take advantage of this powerful new processor. The ESP32 has both WiFi *and* Bluetooth Classic/LE support. That means it's perfect for just about any wireless or Internet-connected project.

The ESP32 is a perfect upgrade from the ESP8266 that has been so popular. In comparison, the ESP32 has way more GPIO, plenty of analog inputs, two analog outputs, multiple extra peripherals (like a spare UART), two cores so you don't have to yield to the WiFi manager, much higher-speed processor, etc. etc!

Comes fully assembled and tested, pre-programmed with ESP32 SPI WiFi co-processor firmware that [you can use in CircuitPython to use this into a WiFi co-processsor over SPI + 2 pins](https://github.com/ladyada/Adafruit_CircuitPython_ESP32SPI). We also toss in some header so you can solder it in and plug into a solderless breadboard.

Here are [specifications from Espressif about the ESP32](https://espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview):
