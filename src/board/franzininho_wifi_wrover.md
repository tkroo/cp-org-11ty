Franzininho WiFi Board is a development board to evaluate ESP32-S2 Modules (Wroom and Wrover) and develop the new generation of Franzininho Boards. The Franzininho project was created to develop skills in people in the areas of electronics and programming, through activities in the DIY format and in conjunction with maker culture in Brazil.

As there are not many boards on the Brazilian market with ESP32-S2, we developed Franzininho WiFi to serve as the ESP32-S2 development platform and help us evaluate and validate applications with this SoC.

This version comes with **ESP32-S2 Wrover module**.
