Blip is a development board for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and 802.15.4 based wireless applications,
based on the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52840 SoC. It has a Black Magic Probe compatible programmer and
debugger built in, along with temperature/humidity sensor, ambient light intensity sensor, and a
3-axis accelerometer. It can be used to prototype very low power devices. It also has provision
for an SD card slot, which makes it a complete and versatile development board.
