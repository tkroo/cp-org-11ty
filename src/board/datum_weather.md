The datum-Weather sensor combines the same SAMD21G18 microcontroller used on the Arduino Zero with the BME280 environmental sensor from Bosch Sensortec to create the simplest, easiest to use weather sensor for your application.

The datum-Weather sensor emulates a serial port over a USB connection, presents the information and data stored on it in a JSON formatted packet, and processes URI style commands to change and retrieve its settings. The datum-Weather sensor fills the gap between a LEGO® Mindstorms® sensor and a breakout board.

The datum-Weather sensor can do much more than just collect the data. The measurement units can be customized to suit your application. Temperature data can be returned in degrees Farenheit or Celsius. Altitude could be in meters or feet. The datum-Weather sensor does all the calculations for you.

It can also apply filters such as min, mix, mean, and RMS to the data stream. This truly makes the datum-Weather sensor a smart sensor that goes far beyond what a breakout board can do.
