PicoPlanet is a procedurally generated series of PCBs. The three planets act as capacitive touch buttons. The board also has a RGB LED on top, a USB-C connector and 4 more pin pads on the bottom. The board's brain is a powerful SAMD21. The design also has stars that are not covered by  copper or soldermask and are perfect spots to place more LEDs.

The board design is generated procedurally and each version of the board is only produced 10 times.
