The RedBoard Turbo uses the ATSAMD21G18, which is an ARM Cortex M0+, 32-bit microcontroller that can run at up to 48MHz. With 4MB of external flash memory and a UF2 (USB Flashing Format) bootloader, the RedBoard Turbo provides an economical and easy to use development platform.

The RedBoard Turbo can be flashed over the Mass Storage Class (MSC) just like a removable flash drive, thanks the the UF2 bootloader. With this bootloader, the RedBoard Turbo shows up on your computer as a USB storage device without having to install drivers and can be used with CircuitPython.
