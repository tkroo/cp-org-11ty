**2x LDO Voltage Regulators?**
Yup! The first one is for the general operation of the board and the ESP32-S2, RAM and Flash. 

The second LDO is for you to use to connect external 3V3 modules, sensors and peripherals, and it has programmable EN control tied to GPIO21 + itâ€™s connected to the deep sleep capabilities of the S2, so if the S2 goes into deep sleep, the 2nd LDO is automatically shut down for you!
