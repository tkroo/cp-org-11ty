ROCK Pi 4 Model C+ is a single board computer (SBC) by a Rockchip RK3399-T hexa-core processor @ 1.5 GHz, equipped with 4GB RAM, and two micro HDMI ports to drive up to one 4K display, and one 2K display.

ROCK Pi 4 Model C+ support dual HDMI output, Micro HDMI 2.0 port up to 4K @ 60 Hz; Micro HDMI 2.0 port up to 2K @ 60 Hz; 4-lane MIPI DSI via FPC connector (only 2 lanes if the SPI flash is soldered to the board); Dual independent display support (not three before the 2K HDMI and MIPI DSI interfaces are multiplexed)

ROCK Pi 4 Model C+ including a 40-pin GPIO interface ,and also features a Gbit LAN for network, with dedicated bus and controller, it works without latency under heavy load network applications.On board 802.11 ac wifi offers 2.4G&5G WLAN connectivity. With Bluetooh 5.0, ROCK Pi benefits improved Bluetooth speed and greater range.

ROCK Pi 4 Model C+ provides support for Debian/Ubuntu Linux, Android 7.1/9.0/11 for the board, with open-source GPU drivers (that should be Panfrost), as well as hardware access/control library for Linux/Android. All RK3399/OP1 processors are software compatible
